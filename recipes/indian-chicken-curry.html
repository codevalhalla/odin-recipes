        <h3>Directions to cook:-</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Gather all ingredients.</p></li>
            <li><p>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. 
                Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; 
                partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. 
                Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. 
                Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, 
                turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat 
                together for about 1 minute while stirring.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine.</p></li>
            <li><p>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. 
                Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. 
                Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 
                about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165<sup>o</sup> F (74<sup>o</sup> C). 
                Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</p></li>
